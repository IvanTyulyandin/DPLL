# DPLL

This is a implementation of DPLL algorithm.
Formula is transformed to CNF with Tseitin algorithm.

There is a test for performance of implementation in Main.hs.
The test: is it possible to color a fully connected graph so that no triple of edges are painted the same color?
To answer this question, a propositional formula is generated, and DPLL is applied to it.
